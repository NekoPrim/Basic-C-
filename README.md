## C# begining practice
Going back over old Prime Repos and redoing in C#.  This repo is for prime-pw-week-2-assignment-part-2.

## Description
Add comments as instructed into the program.cs file.

The file is broken into two sections:

The first section has you describe written code blocks in your own words.
In the second section, there is a description of how the code should work, but the code has an issue or "bug" in it for you to find.
Section 1
For questions 1-3, you will narrate what the code is doing. Remember the code here is correct. Just, describe in your own words what the code is doing.

Example:

// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}
Section 2
For questions 4-6, you are given a description of how the code should behave. The code given will have something logically incorrect, and your job is to find the issue and make a comment describing what is wrong and how to fix it.

Example:

// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number--; 
// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment. 
// Should be number++

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}
